# 🤖 MIT IAP NANDA - AI Agent Development Course

**5-Day Intensive Course on Building and Deploying AI Agents**

Welcome to the MIT IAP NANDA course! Over 5 days, you'll progress from building a simple AI agent to deploying a sophisticated agent capable of competing in an agent battle.

## 📅 Course Structure

### [Day 1: Agent Loop + AI Twin v0](./day-1/)
**What You'll Build:** A simple agent loop (max 5 turns) and your first AI twin using CrewAI (no tools/memory yet)

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding agent loops
- CrewAI fundamentals
- Agent, Task, and Crew concepts
- GitHub repository setup
- Creating AgentFacts for your agent

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+, OpenAI API key, GitHub account

---

### [Day 2: Memory + MCP Tools](./day-2/)
**What You'll Build:** Enhance your agent with memory capabilities and MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools

**Key Concepts:**
- Short-term and long-term memory
- MCP tool integration
- Using external APIs (e.g., Spotify, web search)
- Tool selection and usage patterns

**Prerequisites:** API keys for chosen MCP server (e.g., Spotify, Weather, etc.)

---

### [Day 3: Deploy + REST API + Testbed](./day-3/)
**What You'll Build:** Deploy your agent on Render and expose it via REST API

**Key Concepts:**
- FastAPI integration
- Cloud deployment (Render/Railway)
- REST API design for agents
- Testing in NANDA testbed
- Environment variable management in production

**Prerequisites:** Render account + GitHub connected

---

### [Day 4: Team Coordination Protocol](./day-4/)
**What You'll Build:** Multi-agent systems with coordination protocols

**Key Concepts:**
- Agent-to-agent (A2A) communication
- Google A2A protocol
- Coordination strategies (debate, consensus, hierarchical)
- Multi-agent task decomposition
- Merging agent outputs

**Prerequisites:** Working agents (local or deployed)

---

### [Day 5: Final Submit + Agent Battle](./day-5/)
**What You'll Build:** Polish your agent for the final battle!

**Key Concepts:**
- Agent optimization strategies
- Using advanced tools (web search, stock data, specialized APIs)
- Memory optimization
- Response speed vs. accuracy tradeoffs
- Battle format and evaluation criteria

**The Challenge:** Build the coolest, most capable agent possible! Agents will compete in:
- Trivia across diverse topics (history, science, pop culture)
- Web search challenges
- Stock market analysis
- Art and culture questions
- And more...

**Prerequisites:** Deployed endpoint + consistent input/output format

## 🏆 Course Goals

By the end of this course, you will:
- ✅ Understand AI agent architectures
- ✅ Build agents with memory and tools
- ✅ Deploy production-ready agent APIs
- ✅ Implement multi-agent coordination
- ✅ Have a portfolio-worthy project on GitHub

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start early each day** - Building agents takes time!
2. **Experiment freely** - Try different approaches
3. **Ask questions** - Your instructors and classmates are here to help
4. **Test thoroughly** - Agents can behave unexpectedly
5. **Have fun** - AI agents are exciting technology!
